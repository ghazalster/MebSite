          <h3>Our Principles</h3>
          <h4>Manage with Autonomy</h4>
          <p>The day MEB decided to renew its management structure, it gave autonomy to project managers and site engineers to make the necessary decisions to execute projects to specifications, on time and within budget. Full
client satisfaction is a result of this autonomy</p>
          <h4>Focus on Quality</h4>
          <p>What does “quality” mean? The definition may
Differ depending on who is defining it. MEB defines “quality” as doing it right the first time. Under the establishment Continuous Improvement Program, workers constantly train by group to ensure that they will continue to do their job properly and deliver high
Quality. Our QC/QA Engineers are also deployed in each and every project to double-check the job being done</p>
          <h4>Listen to the client</h4>
          <p>MEB firmly believes that the key for a
Successful project is a good relationship with the client. The client’s comments and suggestions are always most welcomed and acted upon. MEB believes client comments make contributes to a better well positioned MBE</p>
		  <h4>Build on advantage</h4>
          <p>Creativity and innovation will be the intellectual capital of the 21st century. MEB continues to invest in technology, quality of service and design. By building on these elements, our key strength, we strive to deliver World-Class Service</p>
		  <h4>Anticipate the future</h4>
          <p>In the world of continuous change, past performance can no longer predict the future. The establishment is constantly reassessing its operations to shed old practices and methods to anticipate the future needs of its clients</p>
